# Jarvis – Voice Controlled Assistant (Python)

Jarvis is a simple voice-controlled desktop assistant built using Python.  
It listens for a wake word ("Jarvis") and performs basic tasks such as opening websites, playing music, and reading news headlines using an external API.

This project demonstrates practical usage of Python, API integration, environment variable management, and basic system interaction.
